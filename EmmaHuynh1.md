CUSTOM LEGO 65 percent MECHANICAL KEYBOARD that sounds like legos

I am going to build my very first mechanical keyboard. I am very excited to build this because I've always watched videos on youtube and seen my friends build them but I've never been able to afford building one or having a prebuilt keyboard really. The case will be made out of legos and I will modify the switches in a way that it will sound like legos breaking.
Although the LEGO keyboard has been done before, I will customize the case with legos I already have to make it my own!

I am going to build it like a normal mechanical keyboard but with legos and making the switches sound like lego pieces!
